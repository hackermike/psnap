# psnap
Track Python script outputs over time along with keyword expansion in source code.

Important script values can be saved to a dictionary and archived to a file.

The output json file can be processed by psnap to augment special
keywords in the source with their saved values. Syntax is similar to
svn keyword substitution: $varname: value $

See psnap_example for example usage and psnap_example2 for extensions.
